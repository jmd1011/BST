Ordered list of values in the tree: 
3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 50, 99, 115, 
The count of nodes in tree is 10
The count of leaf nodes is 4
The largest value is 115
The smallest value is  3
The 7th smallest value is  15
The 12th smallest value is  No 12-th element
The width of the tree is 8

Fall has come, so the tree sheds its leaves 
Now it looks like: 
      /99
    /50
  /15
>10
    /5
  \4

Now the count of nodes in tree is 6

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 10 and 5
10 is the parent
Looking the other way, 10 is still the parent.

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 10 and 555 No ancestral relation
Lets try out the remove successor function, lets remove the successor of 50
50's successor is 99
With it removed, the tree looks like
    /50
  /15
>10
    /5
  \4

Lets try with a leaf node, lets remove the successor of 5
5's successor is There is no successor
Our tree still looks like
    /50
  /15
>10
    /5
  \4

Lets try with a value not int the tree, lets remove the successor of 1
1's successor is The value 1 is not in the tree
Our tree still looks like
    /50
  /15
>10
    /5

Now lets try making another tree to see if all the functions still work

Ordered list of values in the tree: 
15, 17, 28, 37, 53, 56, 87, 88, 99, 123, 130, 170, 174, 175, 
The count of nodes in tree is 14
The count of leaf nodes is 6
The largest value is 175
The smallest value is  15
The 7th smallest value is  87
The 12th smallest value is  170
The width of the tree is 9

Fall has come, so the tree is shedding its leaves 
Now it looks like: 
  /174
      /170
    \123
>88
    /56
  \53
    \37
      \17

Now the count of nodes in tree is 8

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 88 and 123
88 is the parent
Looking the other way, 88 is still the parent.

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 37 and 170 No ancestral relation

Lets try out the remove successor function, lets remove the successor of 88
88's successor is 123
With it removed, the tree looks like
  /174
    \170
>88
    /56
  \53
    \37
      \17



Now lets try making a really off balance tree to see if all the functions still work
Printing the tree
                  /10
                /9
              /8

          /6
        /5

Ordered list of values in the tree: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
The count of nodes in tree is 10
The count of leaf nodes is 1
The largest value is 10
The smallest value is  1
The 7th smallest value is  7
The 12th smallest value is  No 12-th element
The width of the tree is 10


Fall has come, so the tree is shedding its leaves 
Now it looks like: 
                /9
              /8
            /7
          /6
        /5
      /4
    /3
  /2
>1

Now the count of nodes in tree is 9

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 9 and 1
1 is the parent
Looking the other way, 1 is still the parent.

Looking at the family tree, and want to know the relation between 0 and 9
No ancestral relation

Lets try out the remove successor function, lets remove the successor of 7
7's successor is 8
With it removed, the tree looks like
              /9
            /7
          /6
        /5
      /4
    /3
  /2
>1

Lets try it with the root, lets remove the successor of 1
1's successor is 2
With it removed, the tree looks like
            /9
          /7
        /6
      /5
